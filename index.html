    <p>My name is Chase McFaddin. I was born and raised in small town Kingstree, South Carolina. I grew up playing football, basketball, and baseball in high school. I went to college at Coastal Carolina University in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Recreation & Sport Management. I've had numerous jobs from cropping tobacco, working on a tree nursery, marketing department of a college athletic department, bartending, pest control, fantasy-sport writer, jet-ski tours, and being an interpretitive park ranger. I currently work in sales for a retailer of Verizon-Cellular Sales. My hobbies include fantasy sports, video games, mud runs kayaking, watching lots of television and listening to podcasts to learn new things.
